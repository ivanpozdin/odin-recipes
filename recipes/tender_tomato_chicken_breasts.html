      <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>
        This stewed chicken and tomato recipe is a light, juicy, flavorful dish.
        Being a mom of a 7-month-old child, I've learned to take a lot of
        shortcuts and still be able to cook quality food. This is quick, easy,
        and tasty. If you absolutely must use fresh veggies, that's ok, but
        frozen veggies, in my opinion, work a little bit better. Serve with
        rice, if desired. To kick it up a bit, add chopped green peppers in with
        the tomatoes.

      <ol>
        <li>
          Heat oil in a skillet over medium heat. Season chicken breasts on both
          sides with pepper and onion powder, and arrange in the skillet. Cook 2
          minutes on each side, just until browned. Pour tomatoes and reserved
          liquid over chicken. Pour in broth. Cover skillet, and continue
          cooking 15 minutes on each side, until chicken juices run clear.
        </li>
        <li>
          While chicken is cooking, place frozen mixed vegetables and water in a
          pot. Scoop about 3/4 cup liquid from the skillet, and mix into the
          pot. Bring to a boil, and cook 5 minutes, or until vegetables are
          tender; drain. Arrange chicken breasts over vegetables, and drizzle
          with liquid from the skillet to serve.
